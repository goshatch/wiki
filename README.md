# Wiki

This is a simple Wiki implementation built in Go, based on the [Writing Web Applications tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) from the official Golang website.

Mainly intended as a play project to experiment with Go and `net/http`.

## Getting started

```shell
$ go build
$ ./wiki
Starting server on :8080
```

New pages will be saved as text files under the data directory.
